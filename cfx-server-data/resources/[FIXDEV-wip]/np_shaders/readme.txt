You should be able to use this with NVE or any other fivem client side mods, you might want to remove their weather file, its usually the smallest in the fivem mod package, obviously, you use our shaders, not theirs.

Setup:

Copy mods folder to your fivem mods folder 
Location should look something like this: (C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app\mods)




Copy GTA 5 Folder to your GTA 5 Directory. (This is enbseries, be sure to save any old shit.)
Location should look something like this: (C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V)



Once you are in game, shift+F12 should toggle on or off enbseries, though, you shouldnt need to mess with this, you are free to.
